Pilynth is a library which enables you to write Minecraft mods entirely in C#. It transpiles the CIL bytecode of your project into Java bytecode, and wraps it all up into a JAR, ready to run.

It is very much in the alpha phase, and probably not ready for much more than the most basic mods.

## Usage
Pilynth is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pilynth) for .NET 8. A ready to run example project can be found in its [own repository](https://github.com/LameGrape/pilynth-example).

To create a mod, you must include a class that inherits `FabricMod` in the assembly. The `Identifier` and `Version` attributes must also be used, the former which will be used as the mod namespace. The `ModBuilder` class can then be used to configure and build the mod.
```cs
// Program.cs
new Pilynth.ModBuilder(args)
    .Version("1.21.3")
    .Build();
```
```cs
// mod/Main.cs
using Pilynth.Fabric;

namespace ExampleMod;

[Identifier("pilynth_example")]
[Version("1.0.0")]
public class ExampleMod : FabricMod
{
    public void onInitialize()
    {
        Logger log = LoggerFactory.GetLogger("pilynth_example");
        log.Info("hello pilynth world!");
    }
}
```
Multiple `ModBuilder` instances can be created to build the mod with different settings, such as building for multiple Minecraft versions.

A useable JAR can be generated by running the project. 
```sh
> dotnet run
# The final JAR(s) will be placed in /build
```
