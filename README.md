Pilynth is a library which enables you to write Minecraft mods entirely in C#. It transpiles the CIL bytecode of your project into Java bytecode, and wraps it all up into a JAR, ready to run.

It is very much in the alpha phase, and probably not ready for much more than the most basic mods.

## Usage
Pilynth is available as a NuGet package for .NET 8.

To create a mod, pass the command line arguments into a new instance of `Mod`, and include a class that inherits `FabricMod` in the assembly. The `Identifier` and `Version` attributes must also be used, the former which will be used as the mod namespace. 
```cs
// Program.cs
new Pilynth.Mod(args);
```
```cs
// mod/Main.cs
using Pilynth.Fabric;

namespace ExampleMod;

[Identifier("pilynth_example")]
[Version("1.0.0")]
public class ExampleMod : FabricMod
{
    public void onInitialize()
    {
        Logger log = LoggerFactory.GetLogger("pilynth_example");
        log.Info("hello pilynth world!");
    }
}
```
A useable JAR can be generated by running the project and specifying the Minecraft version. 
```sh
> dotnet run 1.21.3
```
