# Pilynth - Minecraft modding in C#
Pilynth is a library which enables you to write Minecraft mods entirely in C#. It transpiles the CIL bytecode of your project into Java bytecode, and wraps it all up into a JAR, ready to run.

It is very much in the alpha phase, and probably not ready for much more than the most basic mods.
